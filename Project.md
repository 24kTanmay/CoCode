# Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor: Feature Planning

## Overview
A web-based code editor enabling multiple users to collaborate in real-time, powered by a Scala backend and Socket.IO for low-latency messaging. The system is containerized with Docker, orchestrated via Kubernetes, and uses Jenkins for CI/CD automation. Data is persisted in a scalable database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL), with horizontal scaling and auto-scaling support.

## Core Features

### 1. Real-Time Collaboration
- Multi-user code editing with live updates using WebSockets (Socket.IO).
- User presence indicators (who is online, who is editing).
- Real-time cursor and selection sharing.
- Chat or comment system for in-editor communication.
- Conflict resolution strategies (e.g., OT/CRDT algorithms).

### 2. Backend Architecture (Scala)
- RESTful APIs for authentication, project management, and history.
- WebSocket endpoints for collaborative editing and messaging.
- Modular, stateless service design for scalability.

### 3. Persistence Layer
- Store code changes, user sessions, and project metadata in MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
- Efficient diff storage and retrieval for version history.
- Support for rollback and recovery of code states.

### 4. Deployment & Orchestration
- Containerize backend and supporting services with Docker.
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration, service discovery, and load balancing.
- Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for dynamic scaling based on user load.

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
- Jenkins pipeline for automated build, test, and deployment.
- Integration with Docker and Kubernetes for seamless delivery.
- Automated rollback on failed deployments.

### 6. Scalability & Reliability
- Stateless backend for easy horizontal scaling.
- Database sharding/replication for high availability.
- Health checks and auto-restart for failed pods.

### 7. Security
- User authentication and authorization (OAuth/JWT).
- Secure WebSocket and REST API communication (TLS/SSL).
- Role-based access control for projects and files.

### 8. Monitoring & Logging
- Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack).
- Real-time metrics and alerting (Prometheus, Grafana).
- Audit trails for code changes and user actions.

## Advanced Concepts & Challenges
- **Conflict Resolution:** Implement operational transformation (OT) or CRDT for merging concurrent edits.
- **Low-Latency Messaging:** Optimize Socket.IO and backend for minimal delay.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Ensure statelessness and session management for distributed pods.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Use Kubernetes HPA to scale pods based on CPU/memory/user count.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple programming languages and syntax highlighting.
- Plugin system for custom tools (linting, formatting, etc.).
- Integration with external VCS (Git, SVN).
- Mobile and desktop clients.
